So I've gotten it together and have a jekyll blog.  This will hopefully serve as a new place to tell you who I am.

My thinking is that GitHub is as permanent as it is going to get.  Even if they go under, we will all still have our repos.

So maybe this new place grows. Maybe it doesn't.  The first seed is going to be the first version of my open source CV.

I'm going to put together a new resume in Markdown, hosted on GitHub, generated by Jekyll, served as a GitHub page.

The future is getting better all the time.

I'll leave this last note from the default post generated by `jekyll new blogname`, in case anyone is interested... (and you should be!)

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll's GitHub repo][jekyll-gh].
